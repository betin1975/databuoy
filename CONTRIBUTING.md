## Nontechnical Contributions

If you don't write code, you can contribute to this project by letting us know about features you want, errors you've found, or things that you wish worked differently. To do that, [open a ticket](https://github.com/sunlightlabs/databuoy/issues/new)! The worst thing that can happen is that someone will say "we probably can't do that, but thanks for your input!"

## Technical Contributions

We're using GitHub's [issue tracker](https://github.com/sunlightlabs/databuoy/issues) to prioritize development tasks. Feel free to pick off an issue, fork a repo, fix it, and send a pull request.
